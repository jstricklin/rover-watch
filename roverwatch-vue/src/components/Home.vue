        <p><span id="bold">RoverWatch</span> is being actively developed as a means to share my interest in learning about our fascinating solar system. This site is built on the hope to inspire others to look above and remember that we can reach, explore, and strive for more than the limits of our own planet.</p></br>
        <p>At this moment, NASA has deployed three seperate rovers to roam the surface of Mars while taking photos and samples of our neighbor planet - and it is my mission to share these amazing photos for everyone to see.</p>
